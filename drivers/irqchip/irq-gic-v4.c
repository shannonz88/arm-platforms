/*
 * WARNING: The blurb below assumes that you understand the
 * intricacies of GICv3, GICv4, and how a guest's view of a GICv3 gets
 * translated into GICv4 comands. So it effectively targets at most
 * two individuals. You know who you are.
 *
 * The core GICv4 code is designed to *avoid* exposing too much of the
 * core GIC code (that would in turn leak into the hypervisor code),
 * and instead provide a hypervisor agnostic interface to the HW (of
 * course, the astute reader will quickly realize that hypervisor
 * agnostic actually means KVM-specific - what were you thinking?).
 *
 * In order to achieve a modicum of isolation, we try to hide most of
 * the GICv4 "stuff" behind normal irqchip operations:
 *
 * - Any guest-visible VLPI is backed by a Linux interrupt (and a
 *   physical LPI which gets deconfigured when the guest maps the
 *   VLPI). This allows the same DevID/Event pair to be either mapped
 *   to the LPI (host) or the VLPI (guest).
 *
 * - Enabling/disabling a VLPI is done by issuing mask/unmask calls.
 *
 * - Guest INT/CLEAR commands are implemented through
 *   irq_set_irqchip_state().
 *
 * - The *bizarre* stuff (mapping/unmapping an interrupt to a VLPI, or
 *   issuing an INV after changing a priority) gets shoved into the
 *   irq_set_vcpu_affinity() method. While this is quite horrible
 *   (let's face it, this is the irqchip version of an ioctl), it
 *   confines the crap to a single location. And map/unmap really is
 *   about setting the affinity of a VLPI to a vcpu, so only INV is
 *   majorly out of place. So there.
 *
 * But handling VLPIs is only one side of the job of the GICv4
 * code. The other (darker) side is to take care of the doorbell
 * interrupts which are delivered when a VLPI targeting a non-running
 * vcpu is being made pending.
 *
 * The choice made here is that each vcpu (VPE in old northern GICv4
 * dialect) gets a single doorbell, no matter how many interrupts are
 * targeting it. This has a nice property, which is that the interrupt
 * becomes a handle for the VPE, and that the hypervisor code can
 * manipulate it through the normal interrupt API:
 *
 * - VMs (or rather the VM abstraction that matters to the GIC)
 *   contain an irq domain where each interrupt maps to a VPE. In
 *   turn, this domain stis on top of the normal LPI allocator, and a
 *   specially crafted irq_chip implementation.
 *
 * - mask/unmask do what is expected on the doorbell interrupt.
 *
 * - irq_set_affinity is used to move a VPE from one redistributor to
 *   another.
 *
 * - irq_set_vcpu_affinity once again gets hijacked for the purpose of
 *   creating a new sub-API, namely scheduling/descheduling a VPE and
 *   performing INVALL operations.
